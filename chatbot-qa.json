    "types of emf radiation": "There are several types of EMF radiation: Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) from power lines and appliances, Radio Frequency (RF) from wireless devices, Microwave Radiation from microwave ovens and some communications equipment, and Dirty Electricity, which refers to irregular variations in electrical current.",
    "what is non-ionizing radiation": "Non-ionizing radiation is electromagnetic radiation that doesn't carry enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. This includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and visible light. While it can't directly damage DNA like ionizing radiation, research suggests it may still have biological effects through other mechanisms.",
    "what is sar rating": "SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body when exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, typically from cell phones. It's measured in watts per kilogram (W/kg) of body tissue. Lower SAR values indicate less radiation absorption.",
    "difference between emf and emr": "EMF (Electromagnetic Field) refers to the field of force that exists around electrically charged objects. EMR (Electromagnetic Radiation) refers to the waves of energy that travel through space. EMR is essentially energy that propagates through space as a result of oscillating electromagnetic fields.",

    "where can i use this": "You can use emGuarde anywhere you spend time near electronics - your home office, bedroom, living room, workplace, or even when traveling. It's particularly valuable in spaces with multiple electronic devices, WiFi networks, or smart home equipment.",
    "where should i put this thing": "Place your emGuarde where you spend the most time, ideally within 15 feet of your position. Popular spots include: on your desk while working, near your bed for sleeping, in your living room, or in children's rooms. One device covers approximately 1000 square feet.",
    "do i need more than one": "Whether you need multiple emGuarde devices depends on your home size and layout. One device covers about 1000 square feet, so apartment dwellers might need just one, while larger homes benefit from units in multiple frequently-used rooms, especially bedrooms and home offices.",
    "is it worth the money": "emGuarde's value comes from both immediate benefits (many users report better sleep, fewer headaches, and improved focus) and potential long-term health protection. Given the average person's significant daily EMF exposure, many customers find the investment in their well-being worthwhile.",
    "can i just use my phone normally": "Absolutely! Unlike EMF blocking products that interfere with signals, emGuarde allows all your devices to function normally. You'll get full bars on your phone, normal WiFi speeds, and all bluetooth connections will work perfectly - but with less biological impact from the radiation.",

    "do i need to keep it on all the time": "For optimal protection, we recommend keeping your emGuarde powered on continuously. The device is designed for 24/7 operation, consumes minimal electricity (less than a small LED light), and provides constant harmonization of your electromagnetic environment.",
    "will this help brain fog": "Many users report improved mental clarity and reduced 'brain fog' after using emGuarde consistently. While individual results vary, the connection between electromagnetic fields and cognitive function is an active area of research, and many EMF-sensitive individuals report cognitive improvements in harmonized environments.",
    "do i need one for each room": "While one emGuarde covers approximately 1000 square feet, we typically recommend having separate devices for bedrooms and main living/working areas, as these are where you spend the most time and benefit most from protection. Very large rooms may also benefit from multiple units.",
    "how does emguarde compare to cheaper options": "Unlike inexpensive EMF products (stickers, pendants, etc.) that often lack verifiable testing or measurable effects, emGuarde uses active technology that creates a measurable harmonizing field throughout an entire room. Its effectiveness has been verified in laboratory testing, justifying the investment for serious EMF protection.",
    "what happens if i unplug it": "If you unplug your emGuarde, the harmonizing field will dissipate within a short time as it requires power to maintain. There's no harm in temporarily unplugging it when needed, but for continuous protection, we recommend keeping it powered whenever you're in the space.",
    "will this improve my wifi": "emGuarde won't directly improve your WiFi speed or coverage, but some users report more stable connections as the technology helps organize electromagnetic chaos in the environment. Its primary purpose is reducing the biological impact of EMF rather than enhancing connectivity.",
    "does it work through walls": "emGuarde's harmonizing field can extend through standard interior walls, though solid concrete, brick, or metal walls may limit its effectiveness. The field naturally diminishes with distance, so for multi-room protection in homes with many walls, we recommend multiple units.",
    "what's inside the device": "emGuarde contains proprietary quantum harmonization technology including specialized circuits and materials that interact with electromagnetic fields. The exact components are protected intellectual property, but all materials are non-toxic and comply with RoHS standards for electronic devices.",
    "how noticeable are the effects": "The effects of emGuarde vary between individuals. Those with electromagnetic hypersensitivity often notice improvements within days, while others may experience more subtle benefits that develop over weeks. Common reported effects include better sleep, reduced headaches, improved focus, and a greater sense of well-being in EMF-heavy environments.",
