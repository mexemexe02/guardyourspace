# Development Log - Chatbot Fixes

## Issue: Chatbot Not Working Properly

### Problems Identified:
1. `chatInput is not defined` errors in console
2. Enter key not working to send messages
3. Chat toggle button not opening the chat interface
4. Special questions about Dan and demo locations not being answered correctly

### Solution Attempts:

#### Attempt 1: Add Global Variables
- Added global variables for chat elements
- Added Enter key functionality
- Result: Caused duplicate variable declarations

#### Attempt 2: Modify Existing Functions
- Updated sendChatMessage to get fresh references
- Fixed specific answer handling for important questions
- Added Enter key handler in multiple places
- Result: Still encountering errors with duplicate declarations

#### Attempt 3: Clean Implementation Approach
- Created a self-contained chatbot module
- Removed conflicting variable declarations
- Added proper chat toggle functionality
- Improved question handling for critical topics
- Used fresh element references to avoid stale references
- Added fallbacks to ensure initialization succeeds

### Current Status:
Working on resolving the chat interface issues by implementing a clean, conflict-free solution.

### Next Steps:
1. Complete clean implementation of chatbot module
2. Test all chat functionality
3. Verify special question handling
4. Ensure proper error handling

## Chatbot Logic Improvements
- Added special handling for questions about Dan
- Added special handling for questions about demo locations
- Improved question matching algorithm
- Added fallback data if main data file fails to load
